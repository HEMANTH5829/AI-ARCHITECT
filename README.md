# AI Architect

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced AI Architect system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to optimize architectural design and interior space planning.

## Key GitHub Repositories
- [AI Architect Toolkit](https://github.com/example/ai-architect-toolkit) - Tools and libraries to support AI architectural design.
- [Deep Learning Models](https://github.com/example/deep-learning-models) - Repository containing various deep learning models suitable for architectural tasks.

## Training Datasets
- [Architectural Image Dataset](https://example.com/architectural-dataset) - A comprehensive dataset of architectural images for model training.
- [Interior Design Dataset](https://example.com/interior-design-dataset) - Dataset focused on interior design examples and layouts.

## Optimization Algorithms
- Genetic Algorithm: A search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection.
- Simulated Annealing: A probabilistic technique for approximation in optimization problems.

## AI/ML Algorithms
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A class of deep neural networks, are most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
- Reinforcement Learning: A machine learning paradigm that is concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

## Furniture Placement Strategies
- Rule-based approaches for placing furniture based on dimensions and predefined rules.
- Machine learning algorithms to suggest layouts based on user preferences.
